Overview
This repository contains my work related to statistical measures and hypothesis testing. Iâ€™ve explored various topics, including:
Measures of Skewness and Kurtosis: Understanding the shape of data distributions.
Percentiles and Quartiles: Analyzing data distribution at specific points.
Measures of Central Tendency: Investigating central values (mean, median, mode).
Discrete and Continuous Random Variables: Modeling uncertainty.
Confidence Intervals: Estimating population parameters.
Hypothesis Testing: Making inferences about population based on sample data.
